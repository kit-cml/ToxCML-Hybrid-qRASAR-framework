ToxCML is a large-scale hybrid **q‑RASAR** framework-based platform that integrates consensus QSAR and consensus read-across into a weight-optimized workflow for multi-endpoint toxicity prediction. It is designed to provide chemically contextualized, applicability-domain–aware predictions that can support large-scale toxicity screening, hazard prioritization, and reduction of animal testing.

## Study overview

Conventional animal-based toxicity testing is time-consuming, expensive, and ethically challenging, motivating the development of computational in silico methods. In this project, ToxCML combines:
- Machine-learning–based consensus QSAR models built on multiple molecular representations (MACCS, Morgan, APF, RDKit fingerprints, and physicochemical descriptors) using Random Forest, XGBoost, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
- Similarity-based consensus read-across models.
- Pre-computed tiered applicability-domain (AD) annotations for each compound and endpoint (INSIDE vs OUTSIDE).
- Integration of consensus QSAR and consensus read-across into a unified hybrid q‑RASAR framework.

The hybrid q‑RASAR framework predicts **18 toxicity endpoints** for **53,378 unique chemicals**, achieving strong performance on unseen test sets and external validation sets (AUC ≈ 0.86–0.99; ACC ≈ 0.75–0.98). Across endpoints, hybrid q‑RASAR consistently outperforms its individual components, with consensus QSAR remaining highly competitive and consensus read-across providing complementary discriminatory information.

## Toxicity endpoints

ToxCML covers 18 curated toxicity endpoints spanning acute systemic toxicity, organ-specific toxicity, and drug-induced safety liabilities relevant to regulatory and drug discovery contexts.

| No. | Endpoint | Brief definition |
|----:|----------|------------------|
| 1 | **AMES Mutagenicity** | Potential of a compound to induce gene mutations in bacterial test systems (e.g., *Salmonella typhimurium*), serving as an initial indicator of genotoxicity. |
| 2 | **Acute Dermal Toxicity** | Adverse systemic effects or mortality following single or short-term exposure via the skin, typically categorized using dermal LD₅₀ data. |
| 3 | **Acute Inhalation Toxicity** | Toxic responses after brief inhalation exposure to gases, vapors, or aerosols, reflecting systemic hazard via the respiratory route. |
| 4 | **Acute Oral Toxicity** | Systemic adverse effects or death after a single oral dose, classified according to LD₅₀-based regulatory categories. |
| 5 | **Carcinogenicity** | Ability of a compound to induce or promote tumor formation following repeated or long-term exposure. |

## Workflow: step-by-step

The typical workflow for reproducing the ToxCML hybrid q‑RASAR framework is:

### 1. Molecular descriptor and fingerprint computation

**Notebook:**  
`Molecular Descriptor Computation_Preprosesing data.ipynb`  

**Input:**  
- SMILES-based datasets from `Dataset/` (18 endpoints, 53,378 unique compounds).

**What this step does:**  
- Performs structure and label preprocessing (e.g., SMILES validation, duplicate removal, label harmonization).  
- Computes multiple molecular representations for each compound:
  - MACCS keys.  
  - Morgan circular fingerprints.  
  - Atom Pair (APF) fingerprints.  
  - RDKit fingerprints.  
  - Physicochemical descriptors.

**Output:**  
- Feature matrices (fingerprints + physicochemical descriptors) ready for model development.

### 2. Development of the consensus QSAR framework

This stage trains QSAR models separately on fingerprint-based features and physicochemical descriptors, then aggregates them into a consensus QSAR scheme.

#### 2.1 Training fingerprint-based QSAR models

**Notebook:**  
`Training_Consensus QSAR_Fingerprint_10foldCrossvalidation.ipynb`  

**What this step does:**  
- Trains QSAR models using MACCS, Morgan, and APF fingerprints with machine-learning algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM).  
- Applies 10‑fold cross-validation to optimize and assess each fingerprint–algorithm combination.  
- Produces predicted probabilities for each endpoint and configuration.  

#### 2.2 Training physicochemical descriptor–based QSAR models

**Notebook:**  
`Training_Consensus QSAR_PhysicochemicalProperties_10foldCrossvalidation.ipynb`  

**What this step does:**  
- Trains QSAR models using physicochemical descriptors as input features.  
- Performs 10‑fold cross-validation to evaluate predictive stability and select high-performing models.  
- Outputs predicted probabilities for the descriptor-based QSAR models.
  
#### 2.3 Consensus QSAR model evaluation

**Notebook:**  
`Model Performance Evaluation 1_Consensus QSAR.ipynb`  

**What this step does:**  
- Integrates predicted probabilities from selected fingerprint- and descriptor-based models into a **consensus QSAR** probability (e.g., arithmetic mean across models/representations).  
- Evaluates consensus QSAR performance on unseen test sets or external validation sets.  
- Reports ACC, AUC, sensitivity, specificity, and 95% confidence intervals, showing that consensus QSAR is competitive across endpoints.

### 3. Development of the consensus read-across framework

**Notebook:**  
`Model Performance Evaluation 2_Consensus Read-Across Evaluation.ipynb`  

**What this step does:**  
- Implements read-across predictions using similarity between query and training compounds:
  - Computes similarity metrics (e.g., Tanimoto) on MACCS, Morgan, APF, and RDKit fingerprints.  
  - Selects k nearest neighbors and estimates read-across probabilities from their toxicity labels.  
- Aggregates fingerprint-specific read-across probabilities into a **consensus read-across** score.  
- Evaluates consensus read-across using ACC, AUC, and other metrics on unseen data, demonstrating its complementary predictive and discriminatory contribution relative to QSAR.

### 4. Hybrid q‑RASAR integration of consensus QSAR and read-across

**Notebook:**  
`q-RASAR_Evaluation_Framework.ipynb`  

**What this step does:**  
- Integrates the **consensus QSAR** probability and **consensus read-across** probability into a single hybrid **q‑RASAR** probability using a linear weighting scheme:
  $P_{q\text{-}RASAR} = w \cdot P_{QSAR,\ consensus} + (1 - w) \cdot P_{RA,\ consensus}$
- Performs grid search over the weight \( w \) to maximize a joint performance score (e.g., combining AUC and ACC).  
- Evaluates hybrid q‑RASAR on unseen test and external validation sets, showing that the hybrid model consistently outperforms individual consensus QSAR and consensus read-across across the 18 endpoints.

## Applicability domain and chemical space analysis

**Folder:**  
`AD Analysis/`  

**What this step contains:**  
- Pre-computed applicability-domain annotations for all compounds and endpoints, indicating whether each compound is **INSIDE** or **OUTSIDE** the final q‑RASAR AD.  
- These AD labels can be used to filter predictions and interpret model reliability.
